Parallel programs to solve the **Poisson's differential equation** with potential $-\Delta u + q(x,y)u = F(x,y)$  

in the area of $\Pi = \{(x,y): 0 \leqslant x \leqslant 4, 0 \leqslant y \leqslant 3\}$, in which the Laplace operator is  

$\Delta u = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left(k(x,y)\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(k(x,y)\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \right)$

We need boundary conditions to determine the unique solution.  

For the left ($\gamma_L$) and right ($\gamma_R$) boundary conditions of the third type are given:  
$\left( k\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}\right)(x,y) + u(x,y) = \psi(x,y)$  

For the upper ($\gamma_T$) and lower ($\gamma_B$) bounds a second type condition is given:  
$\left( k\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}\right)(x,y) = \psi(x,y)$  

where $n$ is the unit external normal to the boundary.

The true function is $u(x,y)=\sqrt{4+xy}$, $k(x,y) = 4 + x + y$, $q(x,y) = x + y$. 

For the numerical solution we will use **minimal discrepancies method** and **conjugate gradients method**.
